Today is the second week of the open-source SW lecture and I learned how to use GitHub in earnest. I also learned how to create a repository myself and modify the README.md file. It was interesting to note that I could borrow someone else's template or specify a license when I created the repository. I've been worried about how to study GitHub because I don't know how to handle it well, but I'm glad that I'll be able to get to know it step by step through this lecture. I'm looking forward to the next lectures.
